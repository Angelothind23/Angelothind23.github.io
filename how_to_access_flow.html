                            <b>Flow,</b> if you ever felt completely immersed in an activity, you might have been experiencing a mental state that psychologists refer to as flow. What exactly is flow? Imagine for a moment that you are running a race. 
                            Your attention is focused on the movements of your body, the power of your muscles, the force of your lungs, and the feel of the street beneath your feet.
                             You are living in the moment, utterly absorbed in the present activity. Time seems to fall away. You are tired, but you barely notice. 
                             One of the reasons why you experience such a good feeling is because when in the state of flow we produce dopamine and this helps us perform better and feel better.
                            </b>

                            <p class="flow_body">So how do you achieve this mystical state of being? Do you need to meditate or chant anything? No, you don’t (although meditation can improve your ability to concentrate). And Flow is anything but mystical — it’s very practical, and achieving it isn’t mysterious.
                                It can take practice, but you’ll get better at it. Here are the key triggers to achieving and benefiting from Flow:</p>

                            <h1>Now lets dive into some improtant triggers.</h1>

                            <h2>Risk</h2>
                            <p class="flow_body">When extreme sports become more mainstream many records were being beaten on a daily or weekly basis. How? 
                                This question is was asked by Steven Kotler journalist and the author looked into this phenomenon and would realize it all had to do with flow.
                                He would soon become known for his work on altered states. He had realized that the reason that these athletes were breaking so many dangerous records continuously was because it was, by the very nature of extreme sports, dangerous.
                                This danger would cause the mind to release dopamine and contribute to the time dilation that these athletes felt.
                                <div class="flow_body">Of course, not many people would like to go skydive just to enter flow so they could write a book. 
                                    There are ways in which we can introduce risk into our work.
                                    One was is deadlines. The closer we get the more there is an element of risk.
                                </div>
                            </p>
                        </p>
                            <h2>Novelty</h2>
                            <p class="flow_body">
                                This trigger is much more accessible. 
                                The brain likes new things so when it comes into contact with a new experience, new place, new object or new work it will help to get into the flow state.
                                This does not mean that staring at a new blank page will spark flow, the novelty should be engaging.
                                <div class="flow_body">Author Steven Kotler likes to go top a new place to start writing or reading for reaserch.</div>
                             </p>

                             </p>
                             <h2>Intense Focused Attention</h2>
                             <p class="flow_body">This is the most improtant trigger. Without focus your cannot have flow. It simply impossible to be distracted and be in the flow state. 
                                When trying to get in flow you must be working on one thing. There are two ways to focus better. One is to get rid of external distractions. External distractions such as phones, laptops, TVs, and people (you can have group flow but to achieve this you must all be working to one endpoint).
                                Another way is to get rid of internal distractions and strengthen the focus muscle. Internal distractions are things that are bothering you and keep recurring. To get rid of this you can just write these thoughts on to a piece of paper. To strengthen your focus muscle you can try to get into flow more often or meditate.
                                <div class="flow_body"> Meditate, write out thoughts that keep bothering you, get rid of external distractions.</div>
                                </p>
