                            <b>Procrastination</b>, everyone has done it, even Margret Atwood. But why do we do it? Science seems to point to the issue of emotional regulation. A group of researchers found that there was a link between procrastination and executive functioning.
                            Executive functioning is the ability to control behaviour, this can be in the form of self-moderation, emotional control, organization and more. They found that those who procrastinate scored lower in those categories. 
                            A German study found that there was a link between procrastination and the size of the amygdala. The amygdala is the part of the brain associated with the fight or flight response. The good news is that our brains are plastic (can change) and are not rigid.

                            <p class="flow_body">
                                Are you procrastinating reading this now? Hopefully by the end of the article we can get you back to you should be doing.

                            <h2>Forgive yourself</h2>
                            <p class="flow_body">
                               "What? Forgive myself, what for?" It turns out that guilt you feel while procrastinating makes you more likely to continue procrastinating so forgive yourself. 
                               Researchers found that those who forgave themselves were more likely to stop putting things off.
                            </p>
                            <h2>Redifine what success looks like.</h2>
                            <p class="flow_body">
                               If you feel like, due to your previous amounts of procrastination, you won't be able to achieve your goal you set for yourself then once again forgive yourself and redefine the goal. 
                               You need it feel like the goal is acievable and challenging. If it is not achievable then you feel daunted by the task and if it is not challenging then it will be too boring. 
                            </p>
                            
                            <h2>Clear Out distractions</h2>
                            <p class="flow_body">
                                This can be hard for some people. Doing this means saying goodbye to imediate gratification. 
                                This means getting rid of the phone, of the tabs that are distracting. 
                                If you can use a site blocker then you can (I recomend cold turkey blocker).
                                Clearing out the workspace making it ready for the one task you are going to do.
                                If you have thoughts that pop into your head that you have to do something write those down and get back to them later.
                            
                            </p>
                             <h2> Break your task down</h2>
                            <p class ="flow_body">
                                If it seems like you task is to big try breaking it down into chunks. It will seem less looming. This can be especially helpful if you are working on a project. 
                                Now that you have smaller more actionable steps you can be more practical, be less anxious and have more clarity on what you have to do. 
                                It can also be helpful to do the thing surrounding the main part of the task. This can be research instead of writing, this will make you fell more motivated (since you have made progress) and 
                                the task can fell smaller.
